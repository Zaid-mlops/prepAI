Why prepAI?
- Millions of capable students and bootcamp graduates struggle to land software roles—not because they lack potential, but because interview skills, problem framing, and domain-specific readiness are uneven.
- Traditional prep resources are generic and one-size-fits-all. prepAI personalizes learning, gives realistic practice, and explains not only what to fix but how to fix it.

prepAI focuses on:
- Realistic interview simulations (coding + system design + behavioral)
- Personalized progress plans and weakness-driven drills
- Explainable feedback and curated learning resources    
- Warm-up and career readiness: resumes, LinkedIn, and portfolio reviews 


# PrepAI : Crack the Code To Your Future

Gemini 3 Pro + Google AI Studio (example integration)


Problem
- Students receive generic advice like "study algorithms" but struggle to prioritize topics, practice under pressure, or interpret interview feedback.
- Mock interviews are expensive, inconsistent, or lack quality coaching.

Solution
AceInterview is a web app that simulates the entire interview experience:
- Mock Interview: Live simulated interview with multi-turn questioning, timed coding prompts, and behavioral rounds.
- Grading & Feedback: AI critiques solutions across correctness, efficiency, clarity, and communication.
- Replay & Explain: Step-by-step breakdown of candidate's solution with improvements and alternate approaches.
- Personalized Plan: Study plan tailored to weaknesses (e.g., "dynamic programming", "system design basics", "whiteboard communication").
- Career Tools: Resume analysis, STAR-format behavioral coaching, and portfolio review.

How it works (high level)
1. Candidate chooses interview type (Algorithm, System Design, Behavioral).
2. The app launches a timed session that records code, voice (optional), and chat.
3. An LLM (e.g., Gemini) evaluates code correctness with unit tests + reasoning steps, and scores communication quality for behavioral answers.
4. The system returns a report with actionable insights, annotated code, specific practice drills, and recommended resources.

Key features demonstrated
- Multimodal input: code + webcam/voice (optional) + text answers
- Live scoring with unit tests + AI reasoning checks
- Guided replays that pinpoint where the candidate lost time or misunderstood the prompt
- Study plan that adapts as performance improves

⚠️ Disclaimer
PrepAI is a prototyping example. Feedback should be used for learning purposes only. It is not a substitute for live expert coaching where required.

How prepAI Helps Students Land Jobs
- Prioritization: Focused study plans prevent wasted study time.
- Practice Under Pressure: Realistic mock interviews reduce anxiety and improve performance.
- Communication Coaching: Learning to explain solutions is as important as coding them.
- Portfolio & Resume Optimization: Ensures your work shows impact, not just lines of code.

---

Architecture (concise)
- Frontend: React / Next.js (interactive coding + replay)
- Backend: Node.js / Express or serverless API endpoints
- LLM Layer: Configurable adapters for Gemini / OpenAI / other LLMs
- Data: Persist user sessions, annotated replays, and curriculum progress
- Optional: WebRTC for live mock interviews and voice capture

Example flow:
1) User starts mock interview → 2) Frontend streams code + transcript → 3) Backend sends content to LLM + test harness → 4) LLM returns feedback + suggested next steps → 5) Backend stores session + updates progress.

---

Tech Stack & Integrations
- Node.js, npm
- Next.js / React
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB (configurable)
- LLMs: Gemini (via GEMINI_API_KEY), OpenAI, others
- Optional: Docker for local development

---

Getting Started — Run Locally

Prerequisites:
- Node.js v16+ (or the version pinned in the repo)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) A Gemini API key for LLM-powered features

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Environment
Create a .env.local file in the project root with the following entries:
```env
# Required for LLM features (example)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/prepai
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Run the app (development)
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run tests (if available)
```bash
npm test
```

Notes
- If you don't set an LLM key, the app will still run with limited, local-only features or deterministic mocks.
- For secure deployments, store secrets in your cloud provider or GitHub Secrets.

---

Deployment
- Deploy Next.js apps to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred hosting.
- Run migrations and seeders on first deploy.
- Configure runtime environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, etc.)

Usage Example: Simulate a Coding Round (CLI)
```bash
# Start a local server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
# Start a mock interview, choose "Algorithms - Medium", complete prompt, get feedback
```

Contributions we value:
- New mock interview templates (algorithms, system design, behavioral)
- Improved scoring rubrics and test harnesses
- More LLM adapters and safe-system instructions
- UX improvements for replay and feedback

---

Security & Ethics
- AI feedback is probabilistic. Always validate auto-generated interview feedback against a human coach when in doubt.
- We implement guardrails to avoid harmful instructions or biased feedback. If you find an issue, please report it.
- For deployments handling personal data, ensure compliance with local privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) and secure storage of recordings/transcripts.

---

Roadmap
